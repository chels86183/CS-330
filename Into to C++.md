## The History behind C++
>What is the name of your language?

C++

>When/where was it created, and by whom? Was is written to address a particular problem or need?

The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist â€“ Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched. C++ has been traced back to about 1979 when Stroustrup was doing some development for his PhD.

>What types of programming is your language primarily used for? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.



>Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.



## Getting Started with C++
>What did you need to do to install the language?



>Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using?



>How do you run programs in that language?


>How do you write comments in your language?
