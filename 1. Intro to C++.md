# Programming Language Project
for CS 330: Structure and Organization of Programming Language assignment 1


## The History behind C++
>What is the name of your language?

C++

>When/where was it created, and by whom? Was is written to address a particular problem or need?


The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist â€“ Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched. C++ has been traced back to about 1979 when Stroustrup was doing some development for his PhD.

>What types of programming is your language primarily used for? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.


C++ is used to code many different things including but not limited to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, video games, databases, web browsers, operating systems , virtual reality projects, flight simulation software.

Some projects that C++ was used for are:

MySQL server,
Adobe Photoshop,
Adobe Illustrator,
Google Chrome Browser,
Maya (3D software used for animation and other graphics),
and Mozilla Firefox


>Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.


Some of the resources that I will use will include:

## Getting Started with C++
>What did you need to do to install the language?

First you need to choose what type of IDLE, I went with Visual Studio Code(VSCode) since I have familiarity with it, and it is already installed on my laptop. If you choose to go with VSCode then you need to install the C++/C extension on VSCode as well as a compiler (I went with Clang since it is better suited for macs). 

>How do you run programs in that language?

To get a program running in C++ you will first need to "run build" your code compilling it altogether, and then you can run the file as perusual in VSCode with the Run button. 

>How do you write comments in your language?
To write comments in C++ you will use // This would be a single line comment

To comment out multiple lines of code, encase the section in slashes and astericks:

/* This can comment out a big chunk of code */

or 

on macs you can highlight all the lines you want to comment out then click command /
