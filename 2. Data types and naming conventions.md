## Reserved Words
There are some words that should not be used because they are apart of the build in process for C++.

These key word include:
and, and_eq, asm,auto,bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, class, compl, const, double, not_eg, throw, dynamic_cast, operator, true, else, enum
explicit, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, inline, int, const-cast, long, or, or_eg, try, typedef, private, typeid, protected, typename, public, union, register, unsigned, reinterpret-cast, using, return, virtual, short, void, signed, volatile, sizeof, wchar_t, static, while, static_cast, Xor, continue, mutable, struct, xor_eg, default, namespace, switch, delete, new, template, do, not, this.

## Variable naming rules
- Reserved Words are not allowed to be used 
- Variables must be unique from one another (cannot have two variables both named x)
- Must begin with a letter or underscore (1name is not acceptable but oneName or _Name are)
- Very case sensitive, making myVariable and myvariable, are considered two different identifiers
- Variables cannot have spaces or special characters like !, @, $, &, etc.
- Numbers can be a part of a variable as long as they are not at the beginning (hello1 is fine)
